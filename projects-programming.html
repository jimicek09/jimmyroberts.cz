<h2>Programming Projects</h2>
<p>
    Over the past five or six years I have been learning HTML, CSS and some basic Javascript with my Dad
    who works as a software engineer / architect. I have managed to create a few projects that I am proud of and I would
    like to share them with you here. I hope you enjoy them.
