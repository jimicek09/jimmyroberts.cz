<h2>Portfolio</h2>
<div id="content">
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio. I am a 9th grade school student originally from Prague, living in a village called Lety,
        about 25Km south of Prague by the Berounka River in the Czech Republic.</p>
    <p>I am interested in programming, game design and web applications. I am currently learning HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript. I am also interested in creative activities such as pottery, woodwork and origami. I play the piano
        and thanks to my Czech mother and British father, I am bilingual in both Czech and English.</p>
    <p>I have created this website to showcase my projects and to share my contact information.</p>
    <p>Thanks for your interest, I hope you enjoy looking at my work.</p>
